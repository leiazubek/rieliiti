                            <p>So I was playing Ninja Gaiden Black and Otogi on my Original Xbox recently and it got me thinking ‚Äì Where are the ninjas and kunoichis in their own action games this gen? I‚Äôm a huge fan of playing as ninjas in video games. But it seems like ninjas have been missing this generation. I admit, I haven‚Äôt paid much attention to indie games so maybe I‚Äôm missing something there. But as far as ninja-game series goes, ninjas and kunoichis seem to be missing. And I mean action-adventure/stealth based.

Overall Really good book again. Closed up some plot threads and overall just built even more into the final novel, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. No one event really stuck with me like the other books, Avienda‚Äôs viewing would probably be the most emotional and impactful scene to me tbh. Other than that we just had a bunch of really good set pieces. We did have the best fight scene of the series in Perrin vs Slayer though The final battle is coming and Rand has a plan. But it seems like histor. 
Oh boy I might catch some flak for this one. This is going to be a long one, but I keep thinking about S8Ep4 and I gotta say I really, really disliked what the show did here. Look before I even say anything I just want to say; GOT to me is the best TV show ever made in terms of quality of effects and sheer scale. It‚Äôs amazing how far this show has gone from season 1 where they had to have off screen battles and really limited budgets. It‚Äôs amazing how they turned a very niche fantasy novel.

A custom made larger map for more players would be amazing but even the existing maps with 6-8 per match would be fun.
