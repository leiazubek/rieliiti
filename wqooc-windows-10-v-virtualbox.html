                            <p>Hi, Does anyone have clear instructions for how to install windows 10 in Virtualbox. I have installed Virtualbox. I have acquired a windows 10 iso but cannot get it to work. Any help would be gratefully received. hi, I'm using MBP 2015 with broadwell 2C4T processor and trying to install windows 10 on virtualbox. I managed to finish installation but it doesn't recongnize screen resolution well though I installed virtualbox guest addition. I gave it 2 threads and 4 gigs of ram, but it is lagging so much, making me suspect there might be some bug. Anyone had same problem with Mojave Im trying to run Microsoft Access and Windows 10 in Virtualbox. The computer im using is a Macbook. Im not sure what file type to use when creating the virtual machine to run Windows 10 and Access. Hi there, so i installed Windows 10 via VirtualBox 6.0 today, but I can't seem to make it work on a full screen. I installed the Guest Addition but still did not work. You can see the only available options that i have and how the screen looks like. a bit help please. Thanks ! https://i.redd.it/wwu9d9en0sl21.jpg https://i.redd.it/dbshifelyrl21.jpg. I'm running Windows 10 via VirtualBox on a Mac and tried to run Space Engine. I get the error "You have obsolete OpenGL version (1.1). Update your graphics card driver or install compatible hardware." Does anyone know if and how this can be fixed? I previously ran SE through BootCamp, but the hassle of switching OSes led me to try this approach. I'd be really glad if it was possible. Thanks. Hey, I have a problem with the installation program on virtual windows 10 in virtualbox. I got virtual machine from my friend and i would like to install program this machine (engineering stuff). This is pure windows 10 and when I try to install the program suddenly stopped working. I installed this program on my windows 10 there is no problem. On VMware working Jag letar spel som Mysteriet på Greveholm, Robinson-spelet och gamla Jönssonligan-spelen. Spelen finns på TPB men inga seeds så det stannar på 0.0%. Har fixat så jag kan spela på Windows 10 via Virtualbox, det enda som saknas är spelen. I currently run Linux on my laptop and Windows 10 in VirtualBox for work reasons. I decided on a whim to see if I could get a bit of nostalgia running and looked for Return Fire. To my delight, it actually runs! Everything seems to be running ok, except for the color palette. I have to run it in Compatibility Mode: Windows 95 (All other modes except 98/ME yield a WinNT error) Reduced Color mode (8-bit, 256 colour) This is how it should look (https://imgur.com/ykEYWh3). 
Hi all --- When Hyper-V is enabled in Windows 10 Pro, VirtualBox no longer offers the option of 64-bit Linux distros. This is supposed to be because of virtualization hardware constraints – VB needs hardware support for 64-bit virtualization, but Hyper-V is taking it up. So I disabled Hyper-V, rebooted, uninstalled and reinstalled VirtualBox, but it still only offers 32-bit Linux distros even though Hyper-V is gone. How do I get VirtualBox working normally again? I need 64-bit guests. So, we have a Windows 2012 R2 server I'm planning on implementing Active Directory on. Recently, a mission critical PC was infected with malware, and I plan on using Active Directory to lock certain users/PCs down so I don't have as high a chance fixing that issue again. I tested at home with a trial of 2016 server and Windows 10 in Virtualbox, which works great. I am now attempting to find a best way to block websites. Specifically, all but only a few. We have a few websites Hello guys.My main OS is Ubuntu and I am using windows 10 in virtualbox.I am trying to create a backup image of my windows 10 Virtualbox Machine so I will be able to install that backup to my other physical laptop.When I tried to back up to my virtualbox shared folder(\\VBOXSVR\Downloads\) I get the following error: https://i.redd.it/2el9riauvdu11.png I tried the followings, no one does work. 1. I open up services.msc and switch to the Automatic the followings. Hello guys.I am thinking about installing windows 10 to usb stick and using portable instead of using windows 10 on virtualbox.Will there application performance differences between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 or it just be a little faster Hi, I am currently running Ubuntu Linux on my Alienware Alpha. It is my only OS installed. Since I cannot switch to Windows due to not dual booting I was wondering if it's possible to install Windows 10 in Virtualbox, then the Alienware Command Center and then change the Alienfx colors that way. It's a shame that Alienware hasn't made this software compatible with Linux yet. Has anyone tried this before. Okay, first off I've seen a couple posts on here about Sonarr and Virtual Machines but none of them seem to be quite what I'm looking for. Sorry if I missed something obvious though. I've had Sonarr connected to Deluge and running on my Windows PC for quite a while now, but I've just today decided that I'm tired of needing to lose access to whatever server I may be hosting (games, Plex, etc) if I decide to start a download, so I set up a Virtual Machine (also Windows 10) through VirtualBox. So far, I have a Windows 10 free virtualbox, which I've done nothing with. My host machine is running Linux Mint 18.3. I know that most scammers are stupid, but I'm concerned about running into one that could actually hurt me or my machine/network if they're smart enough to do anything with say, my IP. Which steps should I be taking to protect myself and my machine? I have a VPN on my host machine, for what that's worth. 
(Using Windows 10 in VirtualBox on Mac) Went and deleted some (what I thought were) unused folders in my downloads and then tried opening hakchi again, and I got these messages. (https://imgur.com/a/uSPiCov) Now all my games are gone and hakchi looks to be unusable. Is this related to something I deleted, and is it an easy fix? I think I can start from scratch but it's gonna be a real pain in the ass. Any help would be appreciated. I am thinking about moving my main OS for daily usage into a virtual environment. The idea would be to install a pretty slim OS as a host on my desktop/laptop. On top of this I want to install my Windows and Linux OSes which I use as daily drivers for different purposes. Why I am thinking about this, is because of Snapshots and because I have to test and tinker a lot with configuration and new tools and OSes. Virtualization makes my live already so much easier, but the host (at the moment. TL;DR: without any other change, why do several mods not work on the Linux version? Now that the multiplayer update is out fully i decided to see if i can rally up some people for multiplayer. And to make it a bit more exciting i planned on using mods for a larger map, more crops etc (and some for better gameplay like fishing overhaul, npc locations, faster geodes etc.). I had dual boot windows and windows for a long time, played stardew on both. Now i'm only using Linux. I collected Hi all, As the title says. My host is Windows 10, running Virtualbox 5.2.8 r121009. I've installed Solus-3Budgie successfully as guest. I am following these instructions (https://solus-project.com/articles/software/virtualbox/en/#install-the-guest-additions) but I get the following error: `Cannot generate ORC metadata for CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC=y, please install libelf-dev, libelf-devel or elfutils-libelf-devel". STOP.` The only one of those available is `libelf-devel` and after installing 
Running CE 1.2.5 > Windows 10 > VirtualBox > MacBook Pro I posted earlier this weekend (https://www.reddit.com/r/miniSNESmods/comments/8v00zi/please_help_i_think_i_broke_hakchi/) with some screenshots showing how my hakchi had permanently crashed and the various messages it displayed. Some helpful users advised me to copy the usual essential files (art, config, games_snes, user_mods) to a newly installed version of Hakchi CE 1.2.5, which I did. Before I did though, I tested #EBC-A20 LiPo Battery Capacity Tester EBC-A20 Official Specs and Claims: > > EBC-A20 Li-po Battery Capacity Tester 5A Charge 20A Discharge 85W Multifunction Battery Test > > Description: EBC-A20 is a battery test instrument with charge and discharge functionTo test the capacity of lithium battery / lead acid (charge discharge 20A, maximum power 5A, 85W), support separate charge and discharge and a discharge charge test support connected to the computer, can repeatedly charge. Hi, I run Vagrant version 2.0.1 with VirtualBox v. 5.2.2 under Windows 10, all is more or less the latest version. I created machine from image ubuntu/xenial64 (latest version 20171201.0.0). I updated all the packages and installed there MongoDB version 3.4.0. I also exposed MongoDB ports in Vagrantfile. I have no problem to access the DB from the host machine. Now I want to create a new machine from this one as follows: vagrant package --output mongodb.box vagrant box add mongodb mongodb.box. 
I have two GTX 1060 for mining crypto and gaming on Windows and linux. I have dual boot. Will I be able to reinstall everything and put Windows 10 on VirtualBox and use one graphic card for Guest one for Host? I will teach myself how. I just wanna know if that is possible? Thanks. Host: Elementary OS Loki Guest: Windows 10 Pro VirtualBox 5.0.40_Ubuntu r115130 When I installed the Windows 10 guest I had Paravirtualization set to default. That worked fine until a Windows Update wouldn't work. I found I had to set it to KVM to get Windows to take the update and reboot. I have tried setting back to Hyper-V and default and neither will work - won't boot. I have no problem with the KVM other than I can't set my screen resolution is 4:3 aspect ratio and I can't I have the latest XPS13, which the company I work for owns but I manage completely on my own and also use for some limited private things (like watching Netflix when travelling). Currently running Windows, but facing some issues with the audio driver and have recently come in need of running multiple instances of Windows. I figured I'd solve this by running 2-3 VMs of Windows 10 in VirtualBox on top of some sort of lightweight Linux-install. Need to be able to run at least </p>
